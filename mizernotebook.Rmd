This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Before running this code, I want to highlight to the user what changes I have made to the mizer code. Firstly, open the project.R file and find line 141. I have added the "plankton" variable into the function. Now scroll down to lines 279-304. Here we can see the four different plankton growth rates and the user can decide which one they want to use when running the simulation. This is extremely convenient compared to manually changing the code and building the project again.

```{r}
# Load Library
library(mizer)
params <- set_community_model(z0 = 0.1, f0 = 0.7, alpha = 0.2, recruitment = 4e7)
logistic <- project(params, effort = 0, t_max = 100, t_save = 1/12, plankton = "Logistic")
refined <- project(params, effort = 0, t_max = 100, t_save = 1/12, plankton = "Refined")
normal <- project(params, effort = 0, t_max = 100, t_save = 1/12, plankton = "Normal")
seasonal <- project(params, effort = 0, t_max = 100, t_save = 1/12, plankton = "Seasonal")
carrying <- project(params, effort = 0, t_max = 100, t_save = 1/12, plankton = "Carrying")
# These commands project mizer using the four different plankton growth rates 
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
